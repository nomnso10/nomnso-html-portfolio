    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am actively advancing my expertise in cybersecurity, focusing on threat detection, risk management, 
        ethical hacking, and secure system implementation. Alongside this, I have a foundational skill in HTML,
         which I use to create and structure web pages with clarity and precision. Through specialized training,
        certifications, and hands-on experience, I’m strengthening my ability to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks,
        and enhance digital security frameworks. Committed to continuous learning and staying ahead of emerging threats,
         I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios and contribute to building resilient cybersecurity strategies.
        Open to entry-level roles, internships, mentorship opportunities, and professional collaborations.</p> <br />

    <p>Key Project: Design and Implementation of AC/DC Bridge Trainer (Final Year Thesis)</p>
    <p>As part of my final year project, I designed and developed a prototype for an AC/DC Bridge Trainer to enhance practical learning in electrical circuit analysis.
      This project involved designing a hands-on training system to demonstrate rectification processes, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world applications. 
      Through this experience, I honed my skills in circuit design, hardware development, and troubleshooting, while also strengthening my problem-solving and project management abilities.
      I am eager to apply this knowledge to future innovations in power systems and electrical engineering.</p> <br />
